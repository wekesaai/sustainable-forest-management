Creating a repository for sustainable forest management
Ideas on How Technology Can Aid Forest Management:

1. Remote Sensing & Satellite Imaging:
   - Monitor deforestation, forest cover, and illegal logging in real-time.

2. Drones:
   - Conduct aerial surveys for biodiversity assessment and forest health monitoring.

3. Geographic Information Systems (GIS):
   - Map forest resources and plan sustainable land use.

4. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:
   - Predict forest fire risks and analyze large datasets for conservation strategies.

5. Internet of Things (IoT) Sensors:
   - Track soil moisture, temperature, and wildlife movement for ecosystem management.

6. Mobile Applications:
   - Enable communities to report illegal activities and participate in reforestation efforts.

7. Blockchain Technology:
   - Enhance transparency in timber supply chains and ensure sustainable sourcing.

8. Big Data Analytics:
   - Support decision-making through data-driven insights on forest growth and carbon storage.
